# hello-world

My 1st project on git

I am a student in Northeastern University (NEU) currently. I will get my Masterâ€™s degree in Health Informatics at the end of this year, so I am seeking for a job starting January 2017. 

My background includes both computer science and communication engineering. I got my BS in Communication Engineering in Beijing Jiaotong University, China, where I learned programing skills in C/C++ language. Then I learned Java myself. 

In NEU, I have deepened my Java developing techniques, and have finished course in algorithms, database and web development. One of the example is that I have written a module in Java for minecraft. 

I have a work experience in Digital China Network as a software testing engineer. The main part of my job was to ensure the quality of network system and its web authentication site, which includes both functional and performance test by auto test tools (scripts language). In these projects, I demonstrated the ability of code analyzing and communication skills. Also, I have experience of project management during that time, since I was in charge of bugs from users for a period.

I am looking for a programming job in main program language, which means I can learn other languages based on my current experience. Also, I can be a QA tester since I have relative experience with whole software engineering.
